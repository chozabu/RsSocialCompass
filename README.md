Empty Plugin for Retroshare

This is an empty plugin for retroshare with no networking.
It is the LinksCloud plugin stripped down.
I have perhaps done a few silly things, like hardcode the translations.
Please do send a pull request with any further fixes/tweaks/strippings.


## Quick Start:

If you know what you are doing, do that!

otherwise

### Make a new user
```
  useradd retrotester
```
### inspect then run the build and test script (KDE)
```
  cat testit.sh
  ./testit.sh
```
### Exit the new instance of retroshare when done testing
